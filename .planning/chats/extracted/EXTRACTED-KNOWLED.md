10. **Sub-phases created**: 49-A through 49-I
3. All incomplete phases (25-48) integrated into 9 sub-phases
- 1,869 tasks, ~399 lines of planning code
- 2 detailed plan files for each sub-phase
- 2 integration maps (phase → sub-phase) created in 1:

6. Add a `zero-token-indexing` file to `EXTRACTED-KNOWLED.md` that the can easily query the entire conversation history for the project using the symbol table. generate a progress report.
