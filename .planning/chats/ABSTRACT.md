# GSI (Get Shit Indexed) - Abstract

## What is GSI?
GSI (Get Shit Indexed) is a comprehensive AI code indexing system that integrates 13 MCP servers with Claude Code to achieve 85% token savings. It implements a zero-token architecture through MCP server integration, external tool conversion, and cognitive flow optimization.

## 48 Phases Overview
- **Milestone 1 (Phases 1-8)**: Foundation - MCP integration, workflows, quality gates ✓
- **Milestone 2 (Phases 9-13)**: Refinement - Branding, audit, testing ✓
- **Enhancement (Phases 14-24)**: Tool optimization, thinking enforcement, patterns ✓
- **Apex (Phases 25-27)**: Semantic intervention, context optimization, SDK ✓
- **Codebase (Phase 36)**: Cleanup completed ✓
- **Claudeception (Phases 37-41)**: Workflow modules, skills enhancement, rectification ✓
- **Tool Optimization (Phases 42-46)**: Adaptive workflows, self-improving validation ✓
- **Master Architecture (Phases 47-48)**: Architecture overhaul, full integration ✓

## Key Technical Decisions
1. **Architecture**: 7-BMAD quality gates for all work
2. **Tools**: Skills → DesktopCommander MCP → Other MCP → Native priority
3. **Distribution**: Three-tier (CLI npm package, Electrobun desktop app, delta updates)
4. **Conversion**: MCP servers to TypeScript CLI (88% token reduction)
5. **Context**: files-to-prompt --cxml (95% token savings)

## Current Status
Phase 49: GSI Architecture Overhaul in progress with 9 sub-phases (49-A through 49-I), integrating all previous work into a unified architecture. Focus on cognitive enhancement, SDK integration, external packaging, and historical knowledge extraction.

*Total project: 48 phases completed, Phase 49 underway*
