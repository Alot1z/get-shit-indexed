## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

**From 01-01 (MCP Foundation):**
- Desktop Commander MCP is PRIMARY tool for all file/process operations (85-90% token savings)
- Code-Index MCP is PRIMARY tool for code search operations (80-81% token savings)
- Token efficiency data justifies tool-priority.md enforcement rules
- CodeGraphContext MCP unavailable - documented as blocker for later resolution
