# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2025-02-11)

**Core value:** Token-efficient, reliable GSD workflows that leverage all three MCP servers (DC + CI + CG) using proven tool chain patterns.
**Current focus:** Phase 3 - Pending (Phase 2 complete)

## Current Position

Phase: 3 of 8 (complete)
Plan: 4 of 4 (complete)
Status: Phase 3 complete, Phase 4 ready
Last activity: 2026-02-13 — Completed Phase 3 (Documentation Consolidation)

Progress: [███████████████░] 50.0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 7
- Average duration: 5.7 min
- Total execution time: 40 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 | 3 | 3 | 6.3 min |
| 3 | 4 | 4 | 5.5 min |

**Recent Trend:**

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

**From Phase 1 (MCP Foundation):**
- All 3 MCP servers (DC, CI, CG) are operational and verified
- CG server at neo4j://localhost:7687 provides relationship analysis
- Token efficiency of 80-90% for MCP tools vs native confirmed
- Golden pattern (CG -> CI -> CI -> DC -> DC -> CI) fully executable
- Tool priority hierarchy: Skills > MCP > Native enforced
- CG auto-startup via hooks/start-cg-server.ps1 ensures availability

**From Phase 3 (Documentation Consolidation):**
- CODE-INDEX-MCP-GUIDE.md created with all 18 CI tools documented (1139 lines)
- TOOL-PRIORITY-RULES.md enhanced with CG relationship operations (667 lines)
- TOOL-CHAIN-REFERENCE.md unified all 24 patterns with Mermaid diagrams (454 lines)
- DECISION-TREES.md provides 4 decision trees for tool/pattern selection (564 lines)
- Three-server hierarchy established: DC + CI + CG with clear decision points
- All documentation cross-referenced for navigation
