# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2025-02-11)

**Core value:** Token-efficient, reliable GSD workflows that leverage all three MCP servers (DC + CI + CG) using proven tool chain patterns.
**Current focus:** Phase 3 - Pending (Phase 2 complete)

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 8 (complete)
Plan: 3 of 3 (complete)
Status: Phase 1 complete, Phase 2 ready
Last activity: 2026-02-12 — Completed Phase 1 (MCP Foundation)

Progress: [██████████████░] 37.5%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: 6.3 min
- Total execution time: 19 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 | 3 | 3 | 6.3 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 3 plans: 01-01, 01-02, 01-03
- Trend: All successful, efficient execution with CG integration

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

**From Phase 1 (MCP Foundation):**
- All 3 MCP servers (DC, CI, CG) are operational and verified
- CG server at neo4j://localhost:7687 provides relationship analysis
- Token efficiency of 80-90% for MCP tools vs native confirmed
- Golden pattern (CG -> CI -> CI -> DC -> DC -> CI) fully executable
- Tool priority hierarchy: Skills > MCP > Native enforced
- CG auto-startup via hooks/start-cg-server.ps1 ensures availability

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns
