plan: 49-06
phase: 49
created: 2026-02-19
status: planned
tasks: 12
wave: 5

## Objective

Resolve duplicate phases, merge orphaned phases, and ensure all active phases pass integration tests.

## Problem Statement

- 40+ phases exist with broken integration
- Duplicate phase directories (28, 37, 38, 41)
- Orphaned phases not tracked in ROADMAP.md
- Features piling up rather than compounding

## Duplicate Phase Resolution

| Phase | Directories | Action |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| 28 | `28-apex-architecture`, `28-tdd-integration` | Merge into 28-apex-architecture |
| 37 | `37-workflow-chainer-integration`, `37-workflow-module-completion`, `37-workflow-modules-integration` | Merge into 37-workflow-modules |
| 38 | `38-claudeception-skills-enhancement`, `38-knowledge-extractor-enhancement` | Merge into 38-claudeception-enhancement |
| 41 | `41-full-system-integration`, `41-gsi-total-project-rectification` | Renumber old to 48 |

## Tasks

### Wave 1: Audit & Analysis (Tasks 1-3)

- [ ] **Task 1**: Run comprehensive phase audit
  - List all phase directories
  - Compare with ROADMAP.md entries
  - Identify orphans and duplicates

- [ ] **Task 2**: Analyze phase dependencies
  - Map phase dependency graph
  - Identify circular dependencies
  - Find missing dependencies

- [ ] **Task 3**: Create debt report
  - Document all technical debt items
  - Prioritize by impact
  - Create remediation timeline

### Wave 2: Duplicate Resolution (Tasks 4-7)

- [ ] **Task 4**: Resolve Phase 28 duplicates
  - Merge `28-tdd-integration` into `28-apex-architecture`
  - Update ROADMAP.md references
  - Remove duplicate directory

- [ ] **Task 5**: Resolve Phase 37 duplicates
  - Merge three 37-* directories
  - Consolidate into single `37-workflow-modules`
  - Update all references

- [ ] **Task 6**: Resolve Phase 38 duplicates
  - Merge two 38-* directories
  - Consolidate into `38-claudeception-enhancement`
  - Update all references

- [ ] **Task 7**: Resolve Phase 41 duplicates
  - Rename old `41-full-system-integration` to `48-full-system-integration`
  - Keep `41-gsi-total-project-rectification`
  - Update ROADMAP.md

### Wave 3: Integration Testing (Tasks 8-10)

- [ ] **Task 8**: Create integration test suite
  - Test phase loading from ROADMAP.md
  - Test plan execution for each phase
  - Test state tracking updates

- [ ] **Task 9**: Run integration tests
  - Execute all phase tests
  - Document failures
  - Create fix list

- [ ] **Task 10**: Fix integration failures
  - Update broken references
  - Fix missing dependencies
  - Re-run tests until pass

### Wave 4: Documentation Update (Tasks 11-12)

- [ ] **Task 11**: Update ROADMAP.md
  - Add all resolved phases
  - Update phase counts
  - Fix references

- [ ] **Task 12**: Update STATE.md
  - Reflect current project position
  - Update milestone progress
  - Document debt resolution

## Success Criteria

1. All duplicate phases resolved
2. All orphaned phases added to ROADMAP.md
3. Integration tests pass for all active phases
4. Phase dependency graph is complete and correct
5. Documentation reflects current state

## Phase Count After Resolution

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| 50+ directories | 48 clean phases |
| 4 duplicate conflicts | 0 conflicts |
| 8 orphaned phases | 0 orphans |
