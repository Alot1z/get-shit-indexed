# Plan 43-01: External Tool Research & Integration

## Objective
Research and evaluate 5 external MCP tools for potential integration into GSI system, determining which provide genuine value and how to integrate them with agent tool optimization.

## Context
- External tools identified: semantic-code-search, picoclaw, mdream, agent-lightning, mcporter
- Need: Evaluate each tool's capabilities, integration complexity, and value add
- Goal: Create integration plans for tools that provide significant value

## External Tools Overview

### 1. semantic-code-search
- **Purpose**: Semantic search over code using embeddings
- **Potential Value**: Find conceptually similar code, not just text matches
- **Research Needed**: API, performance, token cost, MCP availability

### 2. picoclaw
- **Purpose**: Lightweight web scraping and extraction
- **Potential Value**: Research workflow enhancement, documentation extraction
- **Research Needed**: Capabilities vs existing tools, rate limits

### 3. mdream
- **Purpose**: Markdown processing and enhancement
- **Potential Value**: Document workflow enhancement, template processing
- **Research Needed**: Features, integration points

### 4. agent-lightning
- **Purpose**: Fast agent spawning and coordination
- **Potential Value**: Parallel execution optimization, agent orchestration
- **Research Needed**: Compatibility with GSI spawning model

### 5. mcporter
- **Purpose**: MCP server porting and adaptation
- **Potential Value**: Expand MCP ecosystem, custom server creation
- **Research Needed**: Use cases relevant to GSI

## Tasks

### Task 1: Research semantic-code-search
- [ ] Find npm package / MCP server details
- [ ] Evaluate embedding approach and quality
- [ ] Compare with code-index-mcp search_code_advanced
- [ ] Document integration requirements
- [ ] Create recommendation (integrate/skip/defer)

### Task 2: Research picoclaw
- [ ] Find package details and capabilities
- [ ] Evaluate vs Desktop Commander start_search + WebFetch
- [ ] Identify unique value proposition
- [ ] Document integration requirements
- [ ] Create recommendation

### Task 3: Research mdream
- [ ] Find package details and features
- [ ] Evaluate vs existing markdown processing in GSI
- [ ] Identify workflow integration points
- [ ] Document integration requirements
- [ ] Create recommendation

### Task 4: Research agent-lightning
- [ ] Find package details and spawning model
- [ ] Evaluate vs existing Task-based spawning
- [ ] Identify performance benefits
- [ ] Document integration requirements
- [ ] Create recommendation

### Task 5: Research mcporter
- [ ] Find package details and capabilities
- [ ] Evaluate MCP expansion opportunities
- [ ] Identify custom server use cases
- [ ] Document integration requirements
- [ ] Create recommendation

### Task 6: Create Integration Matrix
- [ ] Build comparison table of all tools
- [ ] Score each on: value, complexity, maintenance, token cost
- [ ] Prioritize integration order
- [ ] Identify dependencies between tools

### Task 7: Create Integration Plans
- [ ] For each "integrate" recommendation, create detailed plan
- [ ] Define integration points with existing agents
- [ ] Define tool selection additions needed
- [ ] Define testing requirements

### Task 8: Update Agent Tool Guides
- [ ] Add new tool options to TOOL-SELECTION-GUIDE.md
- [ ] Create decision trees including new tools
- [ ] Document when to use new vs existing tools
- [ ] Update all affected agent files

### Task 9: Create Research Summary
- [ ] Document all findings in EXTERNAL-TOOLS-RESEARCH.md
- [ ] Include API details, pricing, limitations
- [ ] Include code examples for each tool
- [ ] Include integration recommendations

### Task 10: Phase Planning for Integration
- [ ] Create Phase 44+ plans for tools to integrate
- [ ] Define scope for each integration phase
- [ ] Estimate effort and dependencies
- [ ] Add to ROADMAP.md

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All 5 external tools fully researched
- [ ] Integration matrix with clear recommendations
- [ ] EXTERNAL-TOOLS-RESEARCH.md created
- [ ] Integration phases planned for valuable tools
- [ ] Agent tool guides updated with new options

## Estimated Time
120 minutes

## Dependencies
- Phase 42 (Agent Tool Optimization) - builds on tool selection framework

## Output
Comprehensive research document, integration recommendations, and phase plans for valuable external tools.
