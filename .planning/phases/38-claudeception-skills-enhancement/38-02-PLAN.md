# Plan 38-02: Enhance thinking-config-generator with Auto-Application

## Objective
Transform thinking-config-generator to automatically apply optimal thinking configurations to new and existing GSI commands.

## Context
- Current: Manual skill that suggests configs
- Target: Automatic application to all commands
- Features: Complexity analysis, auto-generation, batch processing

## Tasks

### Task 1: Create Auto-Application System
- [ ] Scan commands directory for commands without thinking_phase
- [ ] Analyze each command for complexity
- [ ] Generate optimal thinking_phase configuration
- [ ] Apply configuration to command frontmatter
- [ ] Log all changes for review

### Task 2: Enhance Complexity Algorithm
- [ ] Add more complexity factors (currently 15, target 25)
- [ ] Add tool combination analysis
- [ ] Add workflow step analysis
- [ ] Add error handling complexity
- [ ] Add MCP server dependency analysis

### Task 3: Create Thinking Templates
- [ ] Create templates/NONE.yaml for simple display commands
- [ ] Create templates/LIGHTWEIGHT.yaml for quick operations
- [ ] Create templates/STANDARD.yaml for multi-step workflows
- [ ] Create templates/COMPREHENSIVE.yaml for complex analysis
- [ ] Add template selection logic

### Task 4: Add Batch Processing
- [ ] Create `gsi thinking apply-all` command
- [ ] Process all commands in commands/gsi/
- [ ] Generate report of changes
- [ ] Add rollback capability
- [ ] Create backup before changes

### Task 5: Add Validation
- [ ] Validate thinking_phase syntax
- [ ] Validate server availability
- [ ] Validate timeout ranges
- [ ] Add configuration health check
- [ ] Create validation report

### Task 6: Add Learning System
- [ ] Track which configs work best
- [ ] Adjust algorithm based on success rate
- [ ] Learn from user modifications
- [ ] Improve suggestions over time
- [ ] Store learning in knowledge base

### Task 7: Documentation
- [ ] Document complexity algorithm
- [ ] Document server selection rules
- [ ] Add configuration examples
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Add best practices

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Auto-application working
- [ ] All GSI commands have thinking_phase
- [ ] Batch processing working
- [ ] Learning system active

## Estimated Time
35 minutes

## Dependencies
- Plan 38-01 complete
