# Plan 38-01: Enhance knowledge-extractor for Multi-Type Generation

## Objective
Transform gsi-knowledge-extractor from skill-only generation to multi-type generation that creates ideas, agents, logic, functions, features, and improvements.

## Context
- Current: Only creates skills from patterns
- Target: Creates 6 types of artifacts from knowledge extraction
- Vision: Every pattern can become multiple types of enhancements

## Tasks

### Task 1: Create Artifact Type System
- [ ] Define ArtifactType enum (SKILL, AGENT, LOGIC, FUNCTION, FEATURE, IMPROVEMENT, IDEA)
- [ ] Create Artifact interface with common properties
- [ ] Create type-specific interfaces for each artifact type
- [ ] Implement type detection from pattern analysis

### Task 2: Add Agent Generator
- [ ] Create agent template from patterns
- [ ] Add agent role extraction from workflow patterns
- [ ] Add agent tool selection based on pattern complexity
- [ ] Generate agent frontmatter automatically
- [ ] Create agent in ~/.claude/agents/

### Task 3: Add Logic/Function Generator
- [ ] Extract logic patterns from workflows
- [ ] Generate TypeScript function from pattern
- [ ] Add function documentation
- [ ] Create function tests
- [ ] Add to lib/generated/ directory

### Task 4: Add Feature Generator
- [ ] Identify feature patterns from command combinations
- [ ] Generate feature specification
- [ ] Create feature implementation plan
- [ ] Add feature to feature-registry
- [ ] Generate CLI commands for feature

### Task 5: Add Improvement Generator
- [ ] Analyze existing commands for improvement opportunities
- [ ] Generate improvement suggestions with rationale
- [ ] Create before/after comparison
- [ ] Add impact assessment
- [ ] Track improvement implementation

### Task 6: Add Idea Generator
- [ ] Extract visionary ideas from patterns
- [ ] Generate new concept proposals
- [ ] Add idea validation criteria
- [ ] Create idea-to-implementation roadmap
- [ ] Track idea evolution

### Task 7: Create Unified Generation Pipeline
- [ ] Create pipeline: Extract → Analyze → Classify → Generate
- [ ] Add type selection logic
- [ ] Implement multi-type generation
- [ ] Add generation quality scoring
- [ ] Create generation history

### Task 8: Update CLI Commands
- [ ] Add `gsi extract all <path>` - Generate all artifact types
- [ ] Add `gsi extract agent <pattern-id>` - Generate agent
- [ ] Add `gsi extract feature <pattern-id>` - Generate feature
- [ ] Add `gsi extract idea <pattern-id>` - Generate idea
- [ ] Add `gsi extract improvement <target>` - Generate improvements

## Success Criteria
- [ ] 6 artifact types supported
- [ ] CLI commands working for all types
- [ ] Generated artifacts are usable
- [ ] Quality scoring working

## Estimated Time
40 minutes

## Dependencies
- Phase 37 complete (all modules integrated)
