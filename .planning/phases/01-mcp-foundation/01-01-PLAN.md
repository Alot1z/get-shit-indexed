<objective>
Verify all three MCP servers (Desktop Commander, Code-Index, CodeGraphContext) are properly configured, connected, and responsive for use in GSD workflows.

Purpose: Establish the foundation for all MCP-enhanced workflows by confirming server connectivity and basic functionality
Output: Verified server status documentation and token efficiency benchmarks
</objective>

  <name>Task 1: Verify Desktop Commander MCP connectivity</name>
  <files>.planning/codebase/MCP-SERVER-STATUS.md</files>
  <action>Test Desktop Commander MCP server connectivity and basic operations:

1. Test file read capability using mcp__desktop-commander__read_file on a known file (e.g., README.md)
2. Test file write capability using mcp__desktop-commander__write_file to create a temp test file
3. Test process operations using mcp__desktop-commander__list_processes
4. Document the results in MCP-SERVER-STATUS.md with:
   - Server name and connection status
   - Available tools tested (read_file, write_file, list_processes, etc.)
   - Response times for each operation
   - Any errors or issues encountered

  <files>.planning/codebase/MCP-SERVER-STATUS.md</files>
  <action>Test Code-Index MCP server connectivity and basic operations:

1. Test code search capability using mcp__code-index-mcp__search_code_advanced with a simple pattern
2. Test file finding using mcp__code-index-mcp__find_files with a common pattern like "*.md"
3. Test file summary using mcp__code-index-mcp__get_file_summary on a known source file
4. Append results to MCP-SERVER-STATUS.md with:
   - Server name and connection status
   - Available tools tested (search_code_advanced, find_files, get_file_summary, etc.)

  <files>.planning/codebase/MCP-SERVER-STATUS.md</files>
  <action>Test CodeGraphContext MCP server connectivity and basic operations:

1. Identify available CodeGraphContext tools (likely for relationship analysis, code graph queries)
2. Test basic connectivity with a simple operation
3. Append results to MCP-SERVER-STATUS.md with:
   - Server name and connection status
   - Available tools tested
   - Response times for each operation
   - Any errors or issues encountered

Note: If CodeGraphContext MCP is not yet available/configured, document this as a blocker for later resolution.</action>

  <name>Task 4: Benchmark token efficiency of MCP vs native tools</name>
  <files>.planning/codebase/MCP-TOKEN-BENCHMARK.md</files>
  <action>Compare token efficiency between MCP and native tools:

1. Run equivalent operations using both MCP and native tools:
   - File read: mcp__desktop-commander__read_file vs Read tool
   - File search: mcp__code-index-mcp__find_files vs Glob tool
   - Code search: mcp__code-index-mcp__search_code_advanced vs Grep tool
2. Document the results in MCP-TOKEN-BENCHMARK.md with:
   - Operation type
   - MCP tool token usage
   - Native tool token usage
   - Token savings percentage
   - Protocol overhead comparison
3. Calculate and document overall token savings percentage (target: 80-90%)

This benchmarking provides the data for justifying MCP-005 requirement (tool priority rules).</action>
  <verify>Check MCP-TOKEN-BENCHMARK.md shows 80-90% token savings for MCP tools compared to native equivalents</verify>
