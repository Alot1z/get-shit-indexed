# Plan 41-03: Enable Continuous Self-Improvement

## Objective
Enable continuous self-improvement where GSI learns from every operation and evolves its capabilities automatically.

## Context
- System: GSI with claudeception integration
- Goal: Continuous learning and evolution
- Features: Auto-learning, auto-enhancement, auto-documentation

## Tasks

### Task 1: Create Learning Daemon
- [ ] Create hooks/learning-daemon.js
- [ ] Monitor all GSI operations
- [ ] Capture operation patterns
- [ ] Store in knowledge-base
- [ ] Schedule periodic analysis

### Task 2: Create Enhancement Engine
- [ ] Analyze captured patterns
- [ ] Identify improvement opportunities
- [ ] Generate enhancement proposals
- [ ] Rank by impact/effort
- [ ] Auto-apply safe enhancements

### Task 3: Create Documentation Generator
- [ ] Auto-generate docs from patterns
- [ ] Update existing documentation
- [ ] Create usage examples
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guides
- [ ] Keep docs in sync with code

### Task 4: Create Metrics System
- [ ] Track learning velocity
- [ ] Track enhancement success rate
- [ ] Track documentation coverage
- [ ] Track system capability growth
- [ ] Display in progress command

### Task 5: Create Evolution Tracker
- [ ] Track version history of generated artifacts
- [ ] Track capability additions
- [ ] Track pattern evolution
- [ ] Track learning milestones
- [ ] Create evolution timeline

### Task 6: Add Safety Mechanisms
- [ ] Backup before auto-enhancement
- [ ] Rollback capability
- [ ] Human approval for major changes
- [ ] Audit log of all changes
- [ ] Change impact assessment

### Task 7: Create Reporting
- [ ] Create daily learning report
- [ ] Create weekly enhancement report
- [ ] Create monthly evolution report
- [ ] Add `gsi evolution report` command
- [ ] Add visualization dashboard

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Learning daemon active
- [ ] Enhancement engine working
- [ ] Documentation auto-generated
- [ ] Metrics tracked
- [ ] Safety mechanisms in place

## Estimated Time
35 minutes

## Dependencies
- Plan 41-02 complete
