## Objective

Perform comprehensive verification of all phases (1-40+), validate command-to-tool mappings, verify integration connections, and ensure system integrity end-to-end.

## Scope

**Mode**: RESEARCH_THEN_EXECUTE
**Coverage**: All phases 1-40+, all commands, all integrations

## Verification Areas

| Area | Focus | Method |
|------|-------|--------|
| Phase Plans | PLAN → SUMMARY verification | File scanning |
| Command Tools | MCP tool usage validation | Code analysis |
| Integration | lib/ module connections | Dependency tracing |
| Branding | GSD residual detection | Pattern search |

## Tasks

### Wave 1: Phase Verification (1-40+)

- [ ] **Task 1**: Iterate all phase directories
  - List all directories in `.planning/phases/`
  - For each, check PLAN.md existence
  - Check SUMMARY.md existence for completed phases

- [ ] **Task 2**: Verify PLAN-SUMMARY consistency
  - Extract tasks from each PLAN.md
  - Verify SUMMARY.md documents completion
  - Flag any missing summaries for completed work

- [ ] **Task 3**: Cross-reference with STATE.md
  - Extract completed phases from STATE.md
  - Verify ROADMAP.md status matches
  - Identify any discrepancies

### Wave 2: Command Verification

- [ ] **Task 4**: Analyze command MCP tool usage
  - Read all files in `commands/gsi/`
  - Extract `allowed-tools` frontmatter
  - Verify MCP tools are listed (mcp__desktop-commander, mcp__code-index-mcp)

- [ ] **Task 5**: Verify tool chain implementation
  - Check if commands use declared tools
  - Flag native tool usage (Read, Write, Bash) where MCP exists
  - Generate compliance report

- [ ] **Task 6**: Validate gsi-tools.js integration
  - Verify commands reference gsi-tools correctly
  - Test command execution paths
  - Document any broken chains

### Wave 3: Integration Verification

- [ ] **Task 7**: Trace lib/pattern-learning connections
  - Find imports/requires of pattern-learning
  - Verify consumers exist and work
  - Document integration graph

- [ ] **Task 8**: Trace lib/reflection connections
  - Find imports/requires of reflection module
  - Verify PostToolUse hook uses it
  - Document data flow

- [ ] **Task 9**: Verify thinking server integration
  - Check lib/thinking/ exports
  - Verify workflows import correctly
  - Test thinking orchestrator calls

### Wave 4: Final Validation

- [ ] **Task 10**: Run comprehensive test suite
  - Execute gsi-tools.test.js
  - Validate all test cases pass
  - Document any failures with root cause

## Verification Checklist

```markdown
## Phase Verification
- [ ] Phases 1-8: All have SUMMARY.md
- [ ] Phases 9-13: All have SUMMARY.md
- [ ] Phases 14-22: All have SUMMARY.md
- [ ] Phases 23-27: Verified status
- [ ] Phases 28-35: Integrated or archived
- [ ] Phases 36-40: Verified status

## Command Verification
- [ ] All 29 commands have MCP tools in allowed-tools
- [ ] No native Read/Write/Bash where MCP exists
- [ ] gsi-tools.js commands work correctly

## Integration Verification
- [ ] lib/pattern-learning → connected
- [ ] lib/reflection → connected
- [ ] lib/thinking → connected
- [ ] lib/prompt-enhancer → connected
- [ ] lib/complexity → connected

## Test Verification
- [ ] gsi-tools.test.js: PASS
- [ ] No regressions detected
```

## Success Criteria

1. [ ] All phases 1-40 verified against STATE.md
2. [ ] All commands use MCP tools correctly
3. [ ] All lib/ modules connected to consumers
4. [ ] Test suite passing 100%
5. [ ] Verification report generated

## Dependencies

- Plan 41-01 (must fix references first)
- gsi-tools.test.js
- STATE.md (source of truth for completion)

## Output

- `VERIFICATION-REPORT.md` in phase directory
- Updated STATE.md with verification status
