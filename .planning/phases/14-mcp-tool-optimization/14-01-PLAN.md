# Plan 14-01: Add read_multiple_files to Workflows

## Goal

All GSI workflows use `read_multiple_files` for batch file reading instead of sequential `read_file` calls.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Audit current workflow file reads
- [ ] Search for all `read_file` calls in workflows
- [ ] Identify patterns with 3+ sequential reads
- [ ] List affected workflows

### Task 2: Update map-codebase.md
- [ ] Replace sequential reads with read_multiple_files
- [ ] Add batch reading example in comments
- [ ] Test token savings

### Task 3: Update plan-phase.md
- [ ] Batch read STATE.md, ROADMAP.md, CONTEXT.md together
- [ ] Add batch reading pattern documentation
- [ ] Test token savings

### Task 4: Update execute-phase.md
- [ ] Batch read all plan files at once
- [ ] Add batch verification pattern
- [ ] Test token savings

### Task 5: Update verify-work.md and verify-phase.md
- [ ] Batch read summary files
- [ ] Add batch verification examples
- [ ] Test token savings

### Task 6: Create batch reading template
- [ ] Add to templates/workflow-patterns.md
- [ ] Include code examples
- [ ] Document token savings

## Verification

- [ ] All workflows use read_multiple_files for 3+ files
- [ ] No sequential read_file patterns remain
- [ ] Token savings documented

## Success Criteria

- 5+ workflows updated
- Batch reading pattern documented
- No sequential read patterns for 3+ files
