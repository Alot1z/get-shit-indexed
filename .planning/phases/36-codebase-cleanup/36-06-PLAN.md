# 36-06: Missing Workflows

## Objective
Create missing workflow files that are referenced but don't exist.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Audit Missing Workflows
**Files**: `workflows/`
**Action**: Compare references in commands/docs vs existing files
**Current files**: plan-phase.md, execute-plan.md, check-plan.md, verify-phase.md
**Referenced but missing**: research-phase.md, map-codebase.md, status.md, diagnose-issues.md
**Done**: Audit complete

### Task 2: Create research-phase.md
**Files**: `workflows/research-phase.md`
**Action**: Create workflow for phase research:
```markdown
# Research Phase Workflow

<purpose>
Conduct research for a phase before planning.
</purpose>

<process>
1. Load phase requirements from ROADMAP.md
2. Identify research areas (stack, features, architecture, pitfalls)
3. Use parallel researchers for efficiency
4. Compile findings into RESEARCH.md
5. Update phase context with research insights
</process>
```
**Verify**: File created with proper structure
**Done**: research-phase.md created

### Task 3: Create map-codebase.md
**Files**: `workflows/map-codebase.md`
**Action**: Create workflow for codebase mapping:
```markdown
# Map Codebase Workflow

<purpose>
Generate comprehensive codebase map for understanding and navigation.
</purpose>

<process>
1. Scan project structure
2. Identify key modules and their purposes
3. Map dependencies between modules
4. Generate CODEBASE-MAP.md
5. Create visualization if requested
</process>
```
**Verify**: File created with proper structure
**Done**: map-codebase.md created

### Task 4: Create status.md
**Files**: `workflows/status.md`
**Action**: Create workflow for status reporting:
```markdown
# Status Workflow

<purpose>
Report current project status and progress.
</purpose>

<process>
1. Read STATE.md for current position
2. Calculate progress percentages
3. List completed phases
4. Identify blockers
5. Present next steps
</process>
```
**Verify**: File created with proper structure
**Done**: status.md created

### Task 5: Create diagnose-issues.md
**Files**: `workflows/diagnose-issues.md`
**Action**: Create workflow for issue diagnosis:
```markdown
# Diagnose Issues Workflow

<purpose>
Diagnose and troubleshoot project issues.
</purpose>

<process>
1. Identify symptoms from user report
2. Search for related code patterns
3. Analyze potential causes
4. Generate diagnosis report
5. Suggest resolution steps
</process>
```
**Verify**: File created with proper structure
**Done**: diagnose-issues.md created

### Task 6: Verify All References
**Action**: Check all workflow @-references resolve
```bash
grep -r "@workflows/" --include="*.md" | while read line; do
  # Extract path and verify exists
done
```
**Verify**: All @workflows/ references valid
**Done**: Verification complete

## Output
- 4 new workflow files
- Consistent workflow structure
- All references valid

**Next**: 36-07 - Duplicate Directory Cleanup
