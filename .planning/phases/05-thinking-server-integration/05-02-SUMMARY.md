# Phase 5 Plan 2: Tractatus Thinking Integration Summary

**Tractatus thinking server integrated for logical structure analysis with proposition-based decomposition and architectural decision support**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 6 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-13T00:53:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-13T00:59:00Z
- **Tasks:** 7
- **Files modified:** 3

## Accomplishments

- Tractatus thinking server API documented with operations, key concepts, and use cases
- Logical structure analysis patterns documented (4 patterns: Concept Decomposition, Architecture Analysis, Problem Clarification, Verification)
- Tractatus integration examples demonstrate practical usage with sequential thinking
- Token-efficient tractatus patterns documented for optimal usage
- 7-BMAD methodology updated with tractatus references for Model/Modd circles

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1-7: Tractatus thinking integration** - `a2c0686` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified

- `.planning/codebase/THINKING-SERVERS.md` - Tractatus thinking server documentation (appended)
- `get-shit-indexed/workflows/research-phase.md` - Updated with tractatus thinking for structural research analysis
- `.planning/codebase/7-BMAD-METHODOLOGY.md` - Updated with tractatus thinking for Model/Modd circles

## Decisions Made

- Tractatus thinking for WHAT (structure/logic) before Sequential for HOW (process/steps)
- Strategic sequencing: Tractatus (structure) -> Sequential (process) -> Tractatus (verify)
- 7-BMAD Model Circle uses tractatus for architecture alignment verification
- 7-BMAD Modd Circle uses tractatus for extensibility analysis

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Tractatus thinking complete, ready for Debug thinking integration (05-03)
- Logical structure analysis patterns support architectural decisions in future phases
