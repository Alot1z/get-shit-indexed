# Plan 23-02: Update Absolute Path References

## Objective

Find and replace all hardcoded absolute paths (like `@~/.claude/rules\`) with relative package references that work on any system.

## Problem

The source code contains hardcoded paths like:
```
@~/.claude/rules\auto-validation.md
@~/.claude/rules\tool-priority.md
```

These won't work when someone installs GSI on another machine.

## Solution

Replace with relative references:
```
@./rules/auto-validation.md
@./rules/tool-priority.md
```

Or with full package path that install.js will resolve:
```
@~/.claude/get-shit-indexed/references/rules/auto-validation.md
```

## Tasks

### Task 1: Find all absolute path references
- [ ] Search for `~/.claude/rules\` patterns
- [ ] Search for `~/.claude/rules/` patterns
- [ ] List all files containing hardcoded paths

### Task 2: Update validation-gates.md
- [ ] Find references to `@~/.claude/rules\`
- [ ] Replace with `@~/.claude/get-shit-indexed/references/rules/`
- [ ] Verify no broken references

### Task 3: Update validation-workflow.md
- [ ] Find references to `@~/.claude/rules\`
- [ ] Replace with `@~/.claude/get-shit-indexed/references/rules/`
- [ ] Verify no broken references

### Task 4: Update code-review-workflow.md
- [ ] Find references to `@~/.claude/rules\`
- [ ] Replace with `@~/.claude/get-shit-indexed/references/rules/`
- [ ] Verify no broken references

### Task 5: Update any other affected files
- [ ] Search for remaining absolute paths
- [ ] Update each file found
- [ ] Document changes

### Task 6: Verify references resolve
- [ ] Check that all @ references can be resolved
- [ ] No broken links remaining

## Path Convention

After install, rules will be at:
```
~/.claude/get-shit-indexed/references/rules/auto-validation.md
~/.claude/get-shit-indexed/references/rules/code-review.md
~/.claude/get-shit-indexed/references/rules/tool-priority.md
~/.claude/get-shit-indexed/references/rules/README.md
```

References should use:
```
@~/.claude/get-shit-indexed/references/rules/FILE.md
```

## Verification

- [ ] No `C:\Users\mose` paths remain in source
- [ ] No hardcoded user paths remain
- [ ] All @ references use tilde convention
- [ ] Files can be found after install

## Commit Message

```
fix(23-02): replace absolute paths with package-relative references

- Update validation-gates.md to use package paths
- Update validation-workflow.md to use package paths
- Update code-review-workflow.md to use package paths
- Replace C:\Users\mose paths with ~/.claude/get-shit-indexed/

This ensures GSI works on any system after npm install.
```
