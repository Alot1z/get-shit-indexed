# Plan 23-01: Move Global Rules to Source Code

## Objective

Copy all 4 global rules files from `~/.claude/rules/` to the source code repository at `references/rules/` so the GSI package is self-contained and installable anywhere.

## Problem

The following files exist only in the global Claude config directory and are NOT in the GSI package:

| File | Global Location | Missing From Source |
|------|-----------------|---------------------|
| auto-validation.md | `~/.claude/rules/` | ❌ Not in package |
| code-review.md | `~/.claude/rules/` | ❌ Not in package |
| tool-priority.md | `~/.claude/rules/` | ❌ Not in package |
| README.md | `~/.claude/rules/` | ❌ Not in package |

These files are referenced in the source code but won't be installed when someone runs `npx get-shit-indexed-cc`.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Create references/rules/ directory
- [ ] Create `references/rules/` directory in source code

### Task 2: Copy auto-validation.md
- [ ] Read `~/.claude/rules/auto-validation.md`
- [ ] Write to `references/rules/auto-validation.md`
- [ ] Update any hardcoded paths to use relative references

### Task 3: Copy code-review.md
- [ ] Read `~/.claude/rules/code-review.md`
- [ ] Write to `references/rules/code-review.md`
- [ ] Update any hardcoded paths to use relative references

### Task 4: Copy tool-priority.md
- [ ] Read `~/.claude/rules/tool-priority.md`
- [ ] Write to `references/rules/tool-priority.md`
- [ ] Update any hardcoded paths to use relative references

### Task 5: Copy rules/README.md
- [ ] Read `~/.claude/rules/README.md`
- [ ] Write to `references/rules/README.md`
- [ ] Update index to reflect new location

## Verification

- [ ] All 4 files exist in `references/rules/`
- [ ] File contents match original (paths updated)
- [ ] No hardcoded user paths remain

## Commit Message

```
feat(23-01): add global rules to source code package

- Copy auto-validation.md to references/rules/
- Copy code-review.md to references/rules/
- Copy tool-priority.md to references/rules/
- Copy README.md to references/rules/

These files are required for the GSI package to be self-contained
and installable without relying on global Claude config modifications.
```
