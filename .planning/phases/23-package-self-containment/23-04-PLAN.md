# Plan 23-04: Verification & Testing

## Objective

Comprehensive verification that the GSI package is fully self-contained and can be installed on any system without relying on global modifications made during development.

## Verification Checklist

### 1. Source Code Completeness

- [ ] All files needed for GSI are in source code repository
- [ ] No files only exist in `~/.claude/` that aren't in source
- [ ] Rules directory exists at `references/rules/`
- [ ] All 4 rules files present in source

### 2. No Hardcoded Paths

- [ ] No `C:\Users\mose` paths in source code
- [ ] No `C:\Users\` paths in source code
- [ ] All @ references use tilde or relative paths
- [ ] Paths work on any operating system

### 3. Install Script Coverage

- [ ] All directories are copied by install.js
- [ ] Rules directory is included in install
- [ ] Uninstall removes all GSI files
- [ ] No orphaned files after uninstall

### 4. Reference Integrity

- [ ] All @ references in workflows resolve
- [ ] All @ references in agents resolve
- [ ] All @ references in commands resolve
- [ ] No broken links in documentation

## Tasks

### Task 1: Create verification checklist
- [ ] Document all files that should be in package
- [ ] Create manifest of expected files
- [ ] Compare against source code

### Task 2: Scan for hardcoded paths
- [ ] Grep for `C:\Users\` patterns
- [ ] Grep for `C:/Users/` patterns
- [ ] List any remaining hardcoded paths
- [ ] Fix or document exceptions

### Task 3: Verify install script coverage
- [ ] Review install.js for all copy operations
- [ ] Ensure rules directory is copied
- [ ] Ensure agents directory is copied
- [ ] Ensure commands directory is copied
- [ ] Ensure hooks directory is copied

### Task 4: Test reference resolution
- [ ] Check each @ reference can be found
- [ ] Verify tilde expansion works
- [ ] No broken documentation links

### Task 5: Create VERIFICATION.md
- [ ] Document verification results
- [ ] List any known exceptions
- [ ] Provide test procedure for future releases

### Task 6: Update ROADMAP.md
- [ ] Mark Phase 23 as complete
- [ ] Add completion date
- [ ] Update phase status

### Task 7: Update STATE.md
- [ ] Record Phase 23 completion
- [ ] Update current position
- [ ] Add decisions made
