# Plan 40-04: Create Self-Improvement Loop

## Objective
Create self-improvement loop where /gsi:claudeception learns from its own operations and continuously improves the GSI system.

## Context
- Command: /gsi:claudeception
- Goal: Self-improving system
- Features: Learning, adaptation, evolution

## Tasks

### Task 1: Create Learning Capture System
- [ ] Capture every claudeception execution
- [ ] Store extraction patterns
- [ ] Store generation success rates
- [ ] Store user feedback
- [ ] Store performance metrics

### Task 2: Create Pattern Evolution
- [ ] Analyze successful extractions
- [ ] Identify high-value patterns
- [ ] Evolve extraction algorithms
- [ ] Improve generation quality
- [ ] Track evolution history

### Task 3: Create Feedback Loop
- [ ] Collect user feedback on generated artifacts
- [ ] Analyze artifact usage
- [ ] Identify improvement opportunities
- [ ] Auto-suggest enhancements
- [ ] Track feedback trends

### Task 4: Create Auto-Enhancement
- [ ] Detect when GSI can be improved
- [ ] Generate improvement suggestions
- [ ] Create implementation plans
- [ ] Auto-apply safe enhancements
- [ ] Track enhancement impact

### Task 5: Create Knowledge Evolution
- [ ] Merge similar patterns
- [ ] Retire obsolete patterns
- [ ] Enhance existing patterns
- [ ] Create pattern hierarchies
- [ ] Track knowledge growth

### Task 6: Add Metrics Dashboard
- [ ] Track extractions per session
- [ ] Track artifacts generated
- [ ] Track success rates
- [ ] Track learning velocity
- [ ] Display in `gsi claudeception status`

### Task 7: Create Scheduled Learning
- [ ] Schedule daily learning analysis
- [ ] Auto-extract from recent conversations
- [ ] Generate periodic improvement reports
- [ ] Apply safe optimizations
- [ ] Create learning history

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Learning capture working
- [ ] Pattern evolution working
- [ ] Feedback loop active
- [ ] Auto-enhancement working
- [ ] Metrics dashboard available

## Estimated Time
35 minutes

## Dependencies
- Plan 40-03 complete
