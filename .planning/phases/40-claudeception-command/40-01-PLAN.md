# Plan 40-01: Clone claudeception to GSI Command

## Objective
Clone the claudeception skill into a GSI command format with proper frontmatter and GSI patterns.

## Context
- Source: ~/.claude/skills/claudeception/skill.md
- Target: commands/gsi/claudeception.md
- Purpose: Self-improving knowledge extraction from conversations

## Tasks

### Task 1: Read Source Skill
- [ ] Read ~/.claude/skills/claudeception/skill.md
- [ ] Extract purpose and context
- [ ] Extract workflow steps
- [ ] Extract patterns used
- [ ] Document knowledge extraction process

### Task 2: Create Command Frontmatter
- [ ] Set name: claudeception
- [ ] Set description: Self-improving knowledge extraction
- [ ] Set allowed-tools with all MCP tools
- [ ] Create thinking_phase configuration
- [ ] Add GSI-specific metadata

### Task 3: Define Allowed Tools
- [ ] Add Desktop Commander tools (read_file, write_file, etc.)
- [ ] Add Code-Index MCP tools (search_code_advanced, etc.)
- [ ] Add thinking servers (sequential, tractatus, debug)
- [ ] Add Task tool for subagents
- [ ] Add knowledge-base tools

### Task 4: Create Thinking Configuration
- [ ] Set mode: COMPREHENSIVE (deep analysis needed)
- [ ] Set servers: [sequential, tractatus, debug]
- [ ] Set bmad_enabled: true
- [ ] Set timeout: 15000
- [ ] Write rationale explaining config

### Task 5: Convert Workflow Steps
- [ ] Convert skill steps to GSI <process> format
- [ ] Add thinking hooks between steps
- [ ] Add MCP tool usage comments
- [ ] Add error handling steps
- [ ] Add verification steps

### Task 6: Add GSI Patterns
- [ ] Add golden pattern comments
- [ ] Add code_index_mcp header
- [ ] Add thinking integration points
- [ ] Add checkpoint references
- [ ] Add state management

### Task 7: Create Command File
- [ ] Write commands/gsi/claudeception.md
- [ ] Include all frontmatter
- [ ] Include converted workflow
- [ ] Include examples
- [ ] Include error handling

## Success Criteria
- [ ] claudeception.md created in commands/gsi/
- [ ] Frontmatter complete
- [ ] Workflow converted
- [ ] Command invocable as /gsi:claudeception

## Estimated Time
30 minutes

## Dependencies
- Phase 39 complete
