# Phase 09 Plan 04: Gap Closure Summary

## One-Liner

Closed Phase 9 verification gaps by updating package.json URLs to Alot1z fork and renaming gsd- prefixed files and directories to gsi-.

## Objective Met

Complete the GSD to GSI transformation with correct fork URLs and consistent file naming across the repository.

## Tasks Completed

| Task | Name | Status | Commit |
|------|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Update package.json URLs to Alot1z fork | DONE | adb9858 |
| 2 | Rename agent files from gsd to gsi prefix | DONE | 5d2293c |
| 3 | Rename commands directory from gsd to gsi | DONE | 9d9a649 |
| 4 | Update internal references to renamed paths | DONE | 0a81f72 |
| 5 | Verify gap closure complete | DONE | - |

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Update all gsd-tools to gsi-tools in workflow files | Ensures internal consistency with renamed bin tool | All 9 workflow files updated |
| Keep glittercowboy references in GSI-REBRANDING.md | Historical documentation of fork origin | No changes to GSI-REBRANDING.md |

## Files Modified

### Created
None

### Modified
- `package.json` - Updated 3 URLs to Alot1z fork
- `agents/gsd-*.md` → `agents/gsi-*.md` - 11 files renamed
- `commands/gsd/` → `commands/gsi/` - Directory renamed (30 files)
- `get-shit-done/workflows/*.md` - 9 files updated with gsi- references

## Key Commits

| Commit | Message |
|--------|---------|
| adb9858 | fix(09-04): update package.json URLs to Alot1z fork |
| 5d2293c | refactor(09-04): rename agent files from gsd to gsi prefix |
| 9d9a649 | refactor(09-04): rename commands directory from gsd to gsi |
| 0a81f72 | fix(09-04): update internal references from gsd to gsi |

## Verification Results

| Check | Expected | Actual | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| package.json URLs | Alot1z/get-shit-indexed | Alot1z/get-shit-indexed | PASS |
| agents/ directory | 11 gsi-*.md files | 11 gsi-*.md files | PASS |
| commands/ directory | gsi/ (no gsd/) | gsi/ | PASS |
| Internal gsd refs | 0 | 0 | PASS |
| glittercowboy refs | Only in GSI-REBRANDING.md | Only in GSI-REBRANDING.md | PASS |

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Tech Stack

### Added
None

### Patterns
- Consistent gsi- prefix for all GSI-specific files and directories
- All workflow files reference gsi-tools and gsi-* agents

## Next Phase Readiness

**Phase 09 Complete** - All verification gaps closed.

### Ready For
- Phase 10 or subsequent work
- Repository is now fully rebranded to GSI with correct fork URLs

### Blockers/Concerns
None
