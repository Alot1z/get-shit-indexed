# Plan 16-03: Create Thinking Server Documentation

## Goal
Create comprehensive documentation for the 3 thinking servers and their integration with 7-BMAD.

## Context
- **Thinking servers:** Sequential, Tractatus, Debug-thinking
- **7-BMAD integration:** Each circle maps to thinking approach
- **Goal:** Help users understand cognitive enhancement

## Tasks

### Task 1: Document Sequential Thinking Server
**Content:**
- [ ] Tool: `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking`
- [ ] Use case: Multi-step problem decomposition
- [ ] Parameters: thought, nextThoughtNeeded, thoughtNumber, totalThoughts
- [ ] 7-BMAD mapping: Method circle (implementation)

### Task 2: Document Tractatus Thinking Server
**Content:**
- [ ] Tool: `mcp__tractatus-thinking__tractatus_thinking`
- [ ] Use case: Logical structure analysis
- [ ] Operations: start, add, analyze, export, navigate
- [ ] 7-BMAD mapping: Model circle (architecture)

### Task 3: Document Debug Thinking Server
**Content:**
- [ ] Tool: `mcp__debug-thinking__debug_thinking`
- [ ] Use case: Systematic debugging with knowledge graph
- [ ] Node types: problem, hypothesis, experiment, observation, learning, solution
- [ ] 7-BMAD mapping: All circles (comprehensive debugging)

### Task 4: Create 7-BMAD Mapping Diagram
**Content:**
- [ ] Visual representation of circles → servers
- [ ] Workflow examples for each circle
- [ ] Integration patterns

### Task 5: Add Thinking Usage Examples
**Content:**
- [ ] Before implementation: Tractatus (WHAT)
- [ ] During implementation: Sequential (HOW)
- [ ] After implementation: Tractatus (verify)
- [ ] When debugging: Debug-thinking

### Task 6: Add Configuration Section
**Content:**
- [ ] How to enable thinking servers
- [ ] MCP server requirements
- [ ] Performance considerations

### Task 7: Commit Draft
**File:** README thinking section
- [ ] Stage draft content
- [ ] Commit with message: "docs(16-03): create thinking server documentation"

## Verification

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All 3 servers documented
- [ ] 7-BMAD mapping included
- [ ] Usage examples provided
- [ ] Configuration documented

### Test Commands
```bash
# Verify thinking documentation
grep -c "sequential-thinking\|tractatus\|debug-thinking" README-DRAFT.md
# Expected: 10+
```

## Dependencies
- Plan 16-01, 16-02

## Notes
- Make it accessible for non-technical users
- Include practical examples
- Link to MCP server documentation
