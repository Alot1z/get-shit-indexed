# Plan 16-03: Thinking Server Documentation

## Goal

README documents all 3 thinking servers with 7-BMAD methodology integration.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Create Thinking Servers overview
- [ ] Sequential Thinking description
- [ ] Tractatus Thinking description
- [ ] Debug Thinking description
- [ ] Server comparison table

### Task 2: Document 7-BMAD methodology
- [ ] 7 circles explained
- [ ] Visual circle diagram
- [ ] Circle descriptions

### Task 3: Create Thinking → 7-BMAD mapping
- [ ] Method → Sequential
- [ ] Mad → Debug
- [ ] Model → Tractatus
- [ ] Mode → Sequential
- [ ] Mod → Tractatus
- [ ] Modd → Tractatus
- [ ] Methodd → Sequential

### Task 4: Add usage examples
- [ ] Before planning: Tractatus
- [ ] During execution: Sequential
- [ ] After completion: Debug reflection
- [ ] Bug investigation: Debug graph

### Task 5: Create decision matrix
- [ ] When to use which server
- [ ] Problem type → Server mapping
- [ ] Quick selection guide

### Task 6: Add integration examples
- [ ] Thinking + MCP tools
- [ ] Thinking in workflows
- [ ] Thinking in hooks

### Task 7: Document token efficiency
- [ ] Thinking session cost (~1-3K tokens)
- [ ] Value vs cost analysis
- [ ] When thinking pays off

## Verification

- [ ] All 3 servers documented
- [ ] 7-BMAD mapping complete
- [ ] Examples provided

## Success Criteria

- Complete thinking server docs
- 7-BMAD integration documented
- Usage examples available
