# Plan 16-02: MCP Tool Comparison Tables

## Goal

README includes comprehensive MCP tool comparison tables with token savings.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Create File Operations table
- [ ] Read: Native vs DC (87% savings)
- [ ] Write: Native vs DC (87% savings)
- [ ] Edit: Native vs DC (87% savings)
- [ ] List: Bash vs DC (93% savings)

### Task 2: Create Batch Operations table
- [ ] 3 files: read_file ×3 vs read_multiple_files (67% savings)
- [ ] 5 files: read_file ×5 vs read_multiple_files (80% savings)
- [ ] 10 files: read_file ×10 vs read_multiple_files (87% savings)

### Task 3: Create Code Search table
- [ ] Grep vs CI.search_code_advanced
- [ ] Glob vs CI.find_files
- [ ] Manual vs CI.get_file_summary
- [ ] Cat vs CI.get_symbol_body

### Task 4: Create Graph Analysis showcase
- [ ] CG capabilities overview
- [ ] 11 CG tools listed
- [ ] Relationship analysis examples
- [ ] Custom Cypher query showcase

### Task 5: Add visual elements
- [ ] Savings percentage badges
- [ ] Color-coded efficiency ratings
- [ ] Comparison bar charts (ASCII)

### Task 6: Add decision flowchart
- [ ] When to use DC vs CI vs CG
- [ ] Tool selection decision tree
- [ ] Quick reference card

### Task 7: Create benchmark summary
- [ ] Overall token savings (80-90%)
- [ ] Per-operation savings
- [ ] Real-world example

## Verification

- [ ] 4+ comparison tables created
- [ ] All 3 MCP servers covered
- [ ] Visual elements added

## Success Criteria

- Comprehensive comparison tables
- Visual savings representation
- Decision flowchart available
