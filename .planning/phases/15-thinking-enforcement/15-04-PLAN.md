# Plan 15-04: Add Thinking Verification Checkpoints

## Goal
Add verification checkpoints after thinking server usage to ensure quality of thought process.

## Context
- **Verification need:** Ensure thinking was actually applied correctly
- **Current gap:** No validation that thinking output was used
- **Solution:** Add checkpoints in workflows and agents

## Tasks

### Task 1: Create Thinking Verification Reference
**File:** `references/thinking-verification.md` (NEW)
- [ ] Document verification criteria for each thinking server
- [ ] Include quality metrics for thinking output
- [ ] Add checkpoint examples

### Task 2: Add Sequential Verification
**Section:** Sequential Thinking Verification
- [ ] Verify total_thoughts reached
- [ ] Check for hypothesis generation
- [ ] Validate final answer provided
- [ ] Criteria: 3-7 thoughts, clear conclusion

### Task 3: Add Tractatus Verification
**Section:** Tractatus Thinking Verification
- [ ] Verify analyze operation completed
- [ ] Check for atomic propositions
- [ ] Validate export to markdown
- [ ] Criteria: 5+ propositions, clear structure

### Task 4: Add Debug Verification
**Section:** Debug Thinking Verification
- [ ] Verify problem node created
- [ ] Check hypothesis-solution chain
- [ ] Validate graph persistence
- [ ] Criteria: problem → hypothesis → experiment → solution

### Task 5: Add Checkpoints to Workflows
**File:** `~/.claude/get-shit-indexed/workflows/*.md`
- [ ] Add verification steps after thinking sections
- [ ] Include checkpoint criteria
- [ ] Add rollback on verification failure

### Task 6: Commit Changes
**File:** New reference and updated workflows
- [ ] Stage all changes
- [ ] Commit with message: "feat(15-04): add thinking verification checkpoints"

## Verification

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Thinking verification reference exists
- [ ] All 3 thinking servers have verification criteria
- [ ] Workflows include checkpoints
- [ ] Quality metrics documented

### Test Commands
```bash
# Verify reference exists
test -f references/thinking-verification.md && echo "PASS" || echo "FAIL"

# Verify workflow checkpoints
grep -l "verification\|checkpoint" ~/.claude/get-shit-indexed/workflows/*.md | wc -l
# Expected: 20+
```

## Dependencies
- Plan 15-01, 15-02, 15-03

## Notes
- Verification ensures thinking is not just invoked but applied
- Checkpoints can be automated in some cases
- Quality metrics help improve thinking usage over time
