# Plan 15-04: Add Thinking Verification Checkpoints

## Goal

Workflows have checkpoints that verify thinking was completed before proceeding.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Design checkpoint format
- [ ] Define checkpoint trigger conditions
- [ ] Define verification criteria
- [ ] Define pass/fail actions

### Task 2: Add pre-execution checkpoint
- [ ] Check thinking invoked
- [ ] Verify appropriate server used
- [ ] Allow proceed/block

### Task 3: Add mid-execution checkpoint
- [ ] Check progress against thinking
- [ ] Suggest revision if off-track
- [ ] Allow continuation

### Task 4: Add post-execution checkpoint
- [ ] Verify goal achieved
- [ ] Trigger reflection thinking
- [ ] Document lessons learned

### Task 5: Create checkpoint template
- [ ] Add to templates/checkpoint-patterns.md
- [ ] Include example checkpoints
- [ ] Add configuration options

### Task 6: Integrate with existing workflows
- [ ] Add checkpoints to execute-phase
- [ ] Add checkpoints to execute-plan
- [ ] Add checkpoints to verify-work

## Verification

- [ ] 3+ checkpoint types defined
- [ ] Templates created
- [ ] Workflows updated

## Success Criteria

- Checkpoints defined for all phases
- Templates available
- Integration complete
