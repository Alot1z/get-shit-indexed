# Plan 15-03: Integrate 7-BMAD with Thinking Servers

## Goal
Create comprehensive mapping between 7-BMAD circles and thinking servers for structured problem-solving.

## Context
- **7-BMAD circles:** Method, Mad, Model, Mode, Mod, Modd, Methodd
- **Thinking servers:** Sequential, Tractatus, Debug
- **Integration:** Each circle maps to specific thinking approach

## Tasks

### Task 1: Create 7-BMAD Thinking Reference
**File:** `references/7-BMAD-THINKING-INTEGRATION.md` (NEW)
- [ ] Document all 7 circles with thinking server mappings
- [ ] Include usage examples for each circle
- [ ] Add decision tree for circle selection

### Task 2: Map Method Circle (Implementation)
**Section:** Method → Sequential
- [ ] Multi-step implementation planning
- [ ] Sequential thought: "Step 1, Step 2, ..."
- [ ] Example: Breaking down feature implementation

### Task 3: Map Model Circle (Architecture)
**Section:** Model → Tractatus
- [ ] Structural analysis before implementation
- [ ] Tractatus operation: "start, add, analyze"
- [ ] Example: Understanding system architecture

### Task 4: Map Mad Circle (Integration)
**Section:** Mad → Debug-thinking + Sequential
- [ ] Integration problem investigation
- [ ] Debug graph for tracking integration issues
- [ ] Example: Debugging API connection failures

### Task 5: Map Remaining Circles
**Section:** Mode, Mod, Modd, Methodd
- [ ] Mode (Pattern): Sequential for pattern matching
- [ ] Mod (Maintainability): Tractatus for structure analysis
- [ ] Modd (Extensibility): Tractatus for future-proofing
- [ ] Methodd (Documentation): Sequential for doc structure

### Task 6: Add 7-BMAD to Workflow Templates
**File:** `templates/*.md`
- [ ] Include 7-BMAD thinking in relevant templates
- [ ] Add circle selection guide
- [ ] Include thinking server invocation

### Task 7: Commit Changes
**File:** New reference and updated templates
- [ ] Stage all changes
- [ ] Commit with message: "docs(15-03): integrate 7-BMAD with thinking servers"

## Verification

### Success Criteria
- [ ] 7-BMAD thinking reference exists
- [ ] All 7 circles mapped to thinking servers
- [ ] Examples provided for each mapping
- [ ] Templates updated with 7-BMAD

### Test Commands
```bash
# Verify 7-BMAD reference
test -f references/7-BMAD-THINKING-INTEGRATION.md && echo "PASS" || echo "FAIL"

# Verify circle mappings
grep -c "Circle\|→" references/7-BMAD-THINKING-INTEGRATION.md
# Expected: 7+
```

## Dependencies
- Plan 15-01, 15-02

## Notes
- 7-BMAD provides structure, thinking servers provide execution
- Tractatus for WHAT (structure), Sequential for HOW (process)
- Debug-thinking for WHEN things go wrong
