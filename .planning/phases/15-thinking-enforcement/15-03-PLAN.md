# Plan 15-03: Integrate 7-BMAD with Thinking Servers

## Goal

Each 7-BMAD circle has a recommended thinking server mapping.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Map Method circle to Sequential
- [ ] Method = implementation steps
- [ ] Use sequential for step-by-step
- [ ] Document pattern

### Task 2: Map Mad circle to Debug
- [ ] Mad = integration debugging
- [ ] Use debug_thinking for connection issues
- [ ] Document pattern

### Task 3: Map Model circle to Tractatus
- [ ] Model = architecture analysis
- [ ] Use tractatus for structure
- [ ] Document pattern

### Task 4: Map Mode circle to Sequential
- [ ] Mode = pattern selection
- [ ] Use sequential for option evaluation
- [ ] Document pattern

### Task 5: Map Mod circle to Tractatus
- [ ] Mod = maintainability structure
- [ ] Use tractatus for decomposition
- [ ] Document pattern

### Task 6: Map Modd circle to Tractatus
- [ ] Modd = extensibility logic
- [ ] Use tractatus for atomic propositions
- [ ] Document pattern

### Task 7: Create 7-BMAD-Thinking matrix
- [ ] Create visual mapping document
- [ ] Add to references/
- [ ] Include usage examples

## Verification

- [ ] All 7 circles mapped
- [ ] Usage patterns documented
- [ ] Matrix created

## Success Criteria

- Complete 7-BMAD → Thinking mapping
- Usage examples provided
- Visual matrix available
