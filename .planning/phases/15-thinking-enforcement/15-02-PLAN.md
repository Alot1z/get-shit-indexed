# Plan 15-02: Add Thinking Workflow Sections to All Categories

## Goal
Add thinking_aware_planning sections to all GSI file categories (agents, commands, workflows, templates).

## Context
- **Categories to update:** Agents (11), Commands (29), Workflows (30), Templates (20)
- **Current state:** Some workflows have thinking sections, most don't
- **7-BMAD integration:** Map thinking servers to 7 circles

## Tasks

### Task 1: Add Thinking Sections to Agents
**File:** `agents/gsi-*.md` (11 files)
- [ ] Add `<thinking_aware>` section
- [ ] Map agent type to appropriate thinking server
- [ ] Include 7-BMAD circle reference
- [ ] Add thinking invocation examples

### Task 2: Update GSI-executor Agent
**File:** `agents/gsi-executor.md`
- [ ] Add Sequential thinking for execution planning
- [ ] Map to Method circle (implementation steps)
- [ ] Add thinking checkpoints during execution

### Task 3: Update GSI-planner Agent
**File:** `agents/gsi-planner.md`
- [ ] Add Tractatus thinking for structural analysis
- [ ] Map to Model circle (architecture understanding)
- [ ] Add Sequential thinking for task breakdown

### Task 4: Update GSI-debugger Agent
**File:** `agents/gsi-debugger.md`
- [ ] Add Debug-thinking for systematic investigation
- [ ] Map to all circles (comprehensive debugging)
- [ ] Add hypothesis generation and verification

### Task 5: Add Thinking Sections to Commands
**File:** `commands/gsi/*.md` (29 files)
- [ ] Add thinking_aware_planning section
- [ ] Include thinking server selection guide
- [ ] Add thinking invocation before complex operations

### Task 6: Update Workflow Thinking Sections
**File:** `~/.claude/get-shit-indexed/workflows/*.md` (30 files)
- [ ] Ensure all workflows have thinking sections
- [ ] Add thinking-aware breakdown steps
- [ ] Include 7-BMAD methodology references

### Task 7: Update Template Thinking Sections
**File:** `templates/*.md` (relevant files)
- [ ] Add thinking examples to subagent templates
- [ ] Include thinking in planner/debug templates
- [ ] Add thinking-aware discovery patterns

### Task 8: Commit Changes
**File:** All modified files
- [ ] Stage all changes
- [ ] Commit with message: "feat(15-02): add thinking workflow sections to all categories"

## Verification

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All 11 agents have thinking sections
- [ ] All 29 commands have thinking_aware_planning
- [ ] All 30 workflows have thinking sections
- [ ] Templates include thinking patterns

### Test Commands
```bash
# Verify agents have thinking sections
grep -l "thinking" agents/gsi-*.md | wc -l
# Expected: 11

# Verify commands have thinking_aware
grep -l "thinking_aware\|sequential-thinking\|tractatus" commands/gsi/*.md | wc -l
# Expected: 29
```

## Dependencies
- Plan 15-01 (PreToolUse hook)

## Notes
- Different agents need different thinking servers
- Planner → Tractatus + Sequential
- Executor → Sequential
- Debugger → Debug-thinking
