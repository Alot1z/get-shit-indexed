<objective>
Analyze and prepare for synchronization from the local GSI directory (~/.claude/get-shit-indexed) to the cloned upstream repository (C:\github-repos\my-claude-code-repos\get-shit-indexed-code-index).

Purpose: Establish a clear understanding of what content exists in each location and create a documented strategy for safe one-way sync (local to clone)
Output: Sync analysis document and synchronization strategy
