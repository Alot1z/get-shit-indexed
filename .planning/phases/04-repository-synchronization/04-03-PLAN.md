<objective>
Commit and push all synchronized changes (including 3-MCP integrations: DC, CI, CG at neo4j://localhost:7687) to the git repository, establishing the cloned repo as the single source of truth for the MCP-enhanced GSD system.

Purpose: Complete the bidirectional sync by committing all changes to git and preparing for push to origin, ensuring the cloned repo is the authoritative source with complete 3-MCP integration
Output: All changes committed to git, repository ready for push, verification of successful sync with 3-MCP documentation
