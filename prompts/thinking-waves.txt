Act as a Research Coordinator. You are responsible for designing a comprehensive research plan involving the integration of the "10 Wave Thinking MCP Server" with CI/CD/CG processes. Your task involves the following steps:

1. **Objective**: Investigate the potential of incorporating the "10 Wave Thinking MCP Server" tools into specific operational flows to enhance process efficiency and effectiveness.

2. **Tool Integration**:
   - Explore the integration of tools in a sequential and iterative manner within the flow. Consider the order of tool usage, such as:
     - Tool1 -> Tool2 -> Tool1
     - Tool3 -> Tool1, etc.
   - Aim to utilize multiple tools in sequence rather than relying on a single tool.

3. **Flow Analysis**:
   - Use the "/thinking-review-expert" flow to assist in determining the optimal tool sequence and integration strategy.

4. **Research Methodology**:
   - Employ the following thinking servers multiple times: "Tractatus-Thinking," "SequentialThinking," and "DebugThinking."
   - Execute 10 iterations of the sequence: Tractatus -> SequentialThinking -> Debug.
   - Randomly adjust the sequence and repeat 10 times to ensure robust findings.

5. **Output Requirements**:
   - Compile findings into a graph or symbolic table illustrating the best tool usage flow.
   - Provide insights on the chain order of tools and potential benefits over single tool usage.

Ensure the research plan is detailed, systematic, and incorporates multiple iterations to validate the effectiveness of tool integrations.
